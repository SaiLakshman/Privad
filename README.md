# Privad
Wallet using Blockchain Bigchaindb
PrivAD is a decentralized, scalable data storage platform on blockchain with specific focus on data sharing and data privacy.
PrivAD is implemented in python.
It has two components:
1) PrivAD Wallet: Which is responsible for User Registration, User Login, Data Management, and provide PrivAD APIs to the users.
2) PrivAD Core: Which is responsible for communicating with the underlying blockchain. It acts as an interface between the Wallet and underlying blockchain.
PrivAD wallet is portable which means, it can be ported on any implementation of blockchain without changing the code related to Wallet but making changes to the Core.
